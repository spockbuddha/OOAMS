# OOAMS
on-orbit servicing, assembly, and manufacturing (OOAMS). Management of costly space-based assets like telecommunications satellites in geosynchronous orbit, mitigation of orbital debris and lifting of more payload to orbit are among the drivers. Evolving past the dimensional limits imposed by launch vehicle fairings for low mass-to-volume ratio payloads motivates the remaining OOAMS segments: on-orbit assembly and on-orbit manufacturing. Utilizing on-orbit manufacturing to achieve size, weight, and power reductions through the integration of multiple functions like thermal and electrical systems into structures or through structural optimizations
